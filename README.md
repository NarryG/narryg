### ðŸ”¥ Cursed """Accomplishments"""
-  Loading a large 45,000 LOC C# library into QT/WXWidgets C++ applications just to use that library to crash them.
-  Custom exception handler injection to prevent processes from crashing as much when injected with garbage data
-  Library to strip away any form of memory protection 
-  Learned Unity well enough to make a multiplayer game supporting 350 users per instance within 4 months because I hate myself
-  Did that Unity thing a second time but this time for 600 players with other programmers
