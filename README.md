## ðŸ”¥ Cursed """Accomplishments""" 
-  Loading 45,000 LOC worth of C# (including Winforms) into QT/WXWidgets C & C++ applications just to use that library to intentionally crash them 
-  Found a cool use after free in the NT Kernel in the process of loading Winforms where it doesn't belong
-  Wrote a library to inject into processes that attempts to hijack their exception handlers and make them keep running
-  Learned Unity well enough to make a multiplayer game supporting 350 users per instance within 4 months because I hate myself and love raising money for charity
-  Did that Unity thing a second time but supporting 600 players
-  Consistently forget I'm playing a game and instead start vuln-hunting
